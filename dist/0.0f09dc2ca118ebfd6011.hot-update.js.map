The Booster Club works to enhance the facilities, equipment\n        and opportunities for our student athletes and coaches.\n        </p>\n        <h3>What do we do?</h3>\n        <p>\n        The following are a few examples of what the Booster Club provides funds\n        for: coaching clinics, team camps, upgrades to sports facilities and\n        possible needed equipment and much more!\n        </p>\n        <h3>What do we need from you?</h3>\n        <p>\n          We need your help! We are in need of more parent involvement. A\n          parent’s level of involvement is completely up to you! Your willingness\n          to become involved with the Booster Club would be greatly appreciated\n          no matter how big or small. We are looking for parents to assist with\n          concession stands and get involved with fund raising possibilities.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Why should you get involved?</h3>\n        <p>\n          Participating in the Boosters is a great way to volunteer your time to\n          provide Paw Paw athletes, coaches and sports programs with additional\n          opportunities that they may not be able to experience otherwise! It’s\n          also a great way to meet more of the parents your kids go to school\n          with and have some fun and laughs at the same time! Another perk for\n          getting involved with the Boosters, if you work a minimum of 10\n          athletic events, you can receive a free sports pass the following year.\n          A person receiving a complimentary pass can apply $55 (cost of a\n          single pass) towards the purchase of a family pass.\n        </p>\n        <h3>When do we meet? Anyone is welcome to attend a meeting!</h3>\n        <p>\n          Meetings are held on the first Monday of each month unless it falls\n          on a holiday, in the high school teacher’s lounge @ 6:30. Meeting\n          information is typically located in the Paw Paw High School daily\n          announcements. The following is contact information for the officers\n          on the Booster Board. Feel free to contact any of them if you have\n          additional questions or if you would like more information about\n          getting involved.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <p>Chairperson – Missy Burch mburch@vbisd.org</p>\n        <p>Vice-Chairperson – Ashley Bowen jashli31@hotmail.com</p>\n        <p>Treasurer – Trish Downard trish.downard@gmail.com</p>\n        <p>Publicity Chairperson – Brenda Atkinson Brenda@bluefrogfundraising.com</p>\n        <p>Concession Stand Trustee – Kellee Davis clarksfamily@hotmail.com</p>\n        <p>Concession Stand Trustee – Sandy Curtis curtissj@comcast.net</p>\n        <p>Fundraiser Chairperson – Andrea Toliver jtoliver_andrea@yahoo.com</p>\n        <p>Fundraiser Chairperson – Janet LeForge Jfroe67001@aol.com</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./client/components/AboutUs.js\n **/"],"sourceRoot":""}
